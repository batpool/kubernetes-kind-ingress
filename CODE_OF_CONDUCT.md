# Code of Conduct

Welcome to my project! This repository exists to showcase my skills, ideas, and engineering practices. While this is primarily a solo project, I'm happy to collaborate, discuss, and learn together.

I follow the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct) as a baseline for behavior. In short:

- Be respectful.
- Be inclusive.
- Be considerate.
- No harassment, abuse, or discrimination of any kind.

By interacting in this repository (issues, pull requests, discussions), you agree to treat others with kindness and professionalism.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or observe unacceptable behavior, please feel free to reach out to me directly at [satyabrata.7059@gmail.com](mailto:satyabrata.7059@gmail.com).

Thanks for visiting! ðŸ™Œ
